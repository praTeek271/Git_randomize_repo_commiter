# Git_randomize_repo_commiter


This is a Python script that automates the process of making commits to a Git repository. It's named `git_commiter.py`.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You also need to have Git installed. You can download Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Usage

To use this script, navigate to the directory containing `git_commiter.py` in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python git_commiter.py
```
Follow the prompts in the terminal to make your commit.

## Contributing

If you have suggestions for how git_commiter.py could be improved, or want to report a bug, open an issue! Contributions of all kinds are welcomed!

## Downloading the resourse files

The script uses a files named `repod_list.json` and `extracted_data.json` to select a random repository from a collection of repository names. The file is included in the repository but they are my github profile repositories.

For you to get your own data you can use the `extractor.py` script to get the data from your own github profile. The script uses the `requests` module to get the data from the "Github API". 

The script then stores the data in a file named `repos_list.json`. After that necessary data __extraction__ is done to generate the `extracted_data.json` file, which is then used by the `git_commiter.py` script to select a random repository from the list.


## Working of the script

The script first selects the repository from a collection of repository names stoted in a file named `repod_list.json` or `extracted_data.json` . It uses Random module to select a random repository from the list. Then it navigates to the selected repository and makes a clone of the repository. Then it navigates to the cloned repository and makes a commit to the repository. The commit message is also generated randomly and is stored in the `ReadMe.md` file of the repository. The script then pushes the commit to the repository. The script then navigates back to the original directory and deletes the cloned repository.

Makeing a commit to a repository is a very important task and should be done with caution.
